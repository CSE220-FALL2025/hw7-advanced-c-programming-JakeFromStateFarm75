# CSE 220 Homework 7

## Compiling your Code
Implement all of the functions inside of the file(s) found in the `src/` directory.


```bash
make
```

## Testing your code
Like before, you can also run the following command to run the test cases:
```bash
make test
```
This will run the test cases found in both `students_tests.c` and `unit_tests.c`. You aren't required to write any of your own test cases, but it is reccomended.

## Submitting your Code
You will be using git to submit your code for this assignment. Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes and collaborate on code with others used by all programmers.

Familiarize yourself with the following commands to save and upload your code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "briefly describe the changes"
git push -u origin main
```

These three commands are essential to using git, but there are other useful commands that can help. You can learn more about them here:
